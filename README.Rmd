This package provides a single function (`str_capture`) for using named capture groups to extract values from strings.  This function is just a wrapper around [stringr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stringr).

`fugly::str_capture()` is very similar to both
[unglue](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/unglue/index.html) 
and `utils::strcapture()`.

This package was written because `stringr` doesn't yet do named capture groups
(See issues for [stringr](https://github.com/tidyverse/stringr/issues/71) and
[stringi](https://github.com/gagolews/stringi/issues/153)), and I needed something
faster than [unglue](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/unglue/index.html)


|                | fugly::str_capture          | unglue:::unglue             | utils::strcapture                |
|----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Speed          | fastest                     | slow                        | faster                           |
| Naming Groups  | inline capture group naming | inline capture group naming | use of prototype to define names |
| Safe + Robust? | dodgy                       | quite safe                  | quite safe                       |

### What do I mean when I say `fugly::str_capture()` is unsafe/dodgy/non-robust?

* It doesn't adhere to standard regular expression syntax for named capture 
  groups as used in perl, python etc.
* It doesn't really adhere to `glue` syntax (although it looks similar at a surface level).
* If you specify delimiters which appear in your string input, then you're going
  to have a bad time.
* It's generally only been tested on data which is:
    * highly structured
    * only ASCII
    * non-pathological


### What's in the box?

* `fugly::str_capture(string, pattern, delim)` 
    - capture named groups with regular expressions
    - returns a data.frame with all columns containing character strings
    - can mix-and-match with non-capturing regular expressions
    - if no regular expression specified for a named group then `.*?` is used.
    - does not do any type guessing/conversion. 


## Installation

You can install from [GitHub](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/fugly) with:

``` r
# install.package('remotes')
remotes::install_github('coolbutuseless/fugly')
```

## Example 1

In the following example:

* Input consists of multiple strings
* capture groups are delimited by `{}` by default.
* the regex for the capture group for `name` is unspecified, so `.*?` will be used
* the regex for the capture group for `age` is `\d+` i.e. match must consist
  of 1-or-more digits

```{r example}
library(fugly)

string <- c(
  "information: Name:greg Age:27 ",
  "information: Name:mary Age:34 "
)

str_capture(string, pattern = "Name:{name} Age:{age=\\d+}")
```

## Example 2

A more complicated example:

* Note the mixture of capturing groups and a bare `.*?` in the pattern which is not returned as a result

```{r}
string <- c(
'{"type":"Feature","properties":{"hash":"1348778913c0224a","number":"27","street":"BANAMBILA STREET","unit":"","city":"ARANDA","district":"","region":"ACT","postcode":"2614","id":"GAACT714851647"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[149.0826143,-35.2545558]}}',
'{"type":"Feature","properties":{"hash":"dc776871c868bc7e","number":"139","street":"BOUVERIE STREET","unit":"UNIT 711","city":"CARLTON","district":"","region":"VIC","postcode":"3053","id":"GAVIC423944917"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.9617149,-37.8032551]}}',

'{"type":"Feature","properties":{"hash":"18edc96308fc1a8e","number":"22","street":"ORR STREET","unit":"UNIT 507","city":"CARLTON","district":"","region":"VIC","postcode":"3053","id":"GAVIC424282716"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.9653484,-37.8063371]}}'
)


str_capture(string, pattern = '"number":"{number}","street":"{street}".*?"coordinates":\\[{coords}\\]')

```



## Simple Benchmark

I acknowledge that this isn't the greatest benchmark, but it is relevant to my
current use-case.

* For large inputs (1000+ input strings), `fugly` is significantly faster than
  `unglue`, `utils::strcapture` and ``ore`
* The rust regex engine [rr4r](https://github.com/yutannihilation/rr4r) is slightly 
  faster than `fugly`
* `unglue` is the slowest of the methods.
* `ore` lies somewhere between `unglue` and `utils::strcapture`

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# remotes::install_github("jonclayden/ore")
# remotes::install_github("yutannihilation/rr4r")
library(ore)
library(rr4r)
library(unglue)
library(ggplot2)

# meaningless strings for benchmarking
N <- 1000
string <- paste0("Information name:greg age:", seq(N))


res <- bench::mark(
  `fugly::str_capture()` = fugly::str_capture(string, "name:{name} age:{age=\\d+}"),
  `unglue::unglue()` = unglue::unglue_data(string, "Information name:{name} age:{age=\\d+}"),
  `utils::strcapture()` = utils::strcapture("Information name:(.*?) age:(\\d+)", string, 
                    proto = data.frame(name=character(), age=character())),
  `ore::ore_search()` = do.call(rbind.data.frame, lapply(ore_search(ore('name:(?<name>.*?) age:(?<age>\\d+)', encoding='utf8'), string, all=TRUE), function(x) {x$groups$matches})),
   `rr4r::rr4r_extract_groups()` = rr4r::rr4r_extract_groups(string, "name:(?P<name>.*?) age:(?P<age>\\d+)"),
  check = FALSE
)
```
