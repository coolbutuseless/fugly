This package provides a single function (`str_capture`) for using named capture 
groups to extract values from strings. A key requirement for readability is that 
the names of the capture groups are specified inline as part of the regex, 
and not in an external vector or as separate names.

`fugly::str_capture()` is implemented as a wrapper around 
[stringr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stringr). This is because `stringr` 
itself does not yet do named capture groups (See issues for 
[stringr](https://github.com/tidyverse/stringr/issues/71) and 
[stringi](https://github.com/gagolews/stringi/issues/153)).

`fugly::str_capture()` is very similar to a number of existing packages. See
table below for a comparison.

| Method                      | Speed    | Inline capture group naming | robust |
|-----------------------------|----------|-----------------------------|--------|
| `fugly::str_capture`        | Fast     | Yes                         | No     |
| `rr4r::rr4r_extract_groups` | Fast     | Yes                         | Yes    |
| `nc::capture_first_vec`     | Fast     | No                          | Yes    |
| `tidy::extract`             | Fast     | No                          | Yes    |
| `utils::strcapture`         | Middling | No                          | Yes    |
| `unglue::unglue`            | Slow     | Yes                         | Yes    |
| `ore::ore_search`           | Slow     | Yes                         | Yes    |

### What do I mean when I say `fugly::str_capture()` is unsafe/dodgy/non-robust?

-   It doesn't adhere to standard regular expression syntax for named capture groups as used in perl, python etc.

-   It doesn't really adhere to `glue` syntax (although it looks similar at a surface level).

-   If you specify delimiters which appear in your string input, then you're going to have a bad time.

-   It's generally only been tested on data which is:

    -   highly structured
    -   only ASCII
    -   non-pathological

### What's in the box?

-   `fugly::str_capture(string, pattern, delim)`

    -   capture named groups with regular expressions
    -   returns a data.frame with all columns containing character strings
    -   can mix-and-match with non-capturing regular expressions
    -   if no regular expression specified for a named group then `.*?` is used.
    -   does not do any type guessing/conversion.

## Installation

You can install from [GitHub](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/fugly) with:

``` r
# install.package('remotes')
remotes::install_github('coolbutuseless/fugly')
```

## Example 1

In the following example:

-   Input consists of multiple strings
-   capture groups are delimited by `{}` by default.
-   the regex for the capture group for `name` is unspecified, so `.*?` will be used
-   the regex for the capture group for `age` is `\d+` i.e. match must consist of 1-or-more digits

```{r example}
library(fugly)

string <- c(
  "information: Name:greg Age:27 ",
  "information: Name:mary Age:34 "
)

str_capture(string, pattern = "Name:{name} Age:{age=\\d+}")
```

## Example 2

A more complicated example:

-   Note the mixture of capturing groups and a bare `.*?` in the pattern which is not returned as a result

```{r}
string <- c(
'{"type":"Feature","properties":{"hash":"1348778913c0224a","number":"27","street":"BANAMBILA STREET","unit":"","city":"ARANDA","district":"","region":"ACT","postcode":"2614","id":"GAACT714851647"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[149.0826143,-35.2545558]}}',
'{"type":"Feature","properties":{"hash":"dc776871c868bc7e","number":"139","street":"BOUVERIE STREET","unit":"UNIT 711","city":"CARLTON","district":"","region":"VIC","postcode":"3053","id":"GAVIC423944917"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.9617149,-37.8032551]}}',
'{"type":"Feature","properties":{"hash":"8197f34a40ccad47","number":"6","street":"MOGRIDGE STREET","unit":"","city":"WARWICK","district":"","region":"QLD","postcode":"4370","id":"GAQLD155949502"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[152.0230999,-28.2230133]}}',
'{"type":"Feature","properties":{"hash":"18edc96308fc1a8e","number":"22","street":"ORR STREET","unit":"UNIT 507","city":"CARLTON","district":"","region":"VIC","postcode":"3053","id":"GAVIC424282716"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[144.9653484,-37.8063371]}}'
)


str_capture(string, pattern = '"number":"{number}","street":"{street}".*?"coordinates":\\[{coords}\\]')

```

## Simple Benchmark

I acknowledge that this isn't the greatest benchmark, but it is relevant to my current use-case.

-   [nc](https://github.com/tdhock/nc) with the PCRE regex engine is the fastest named capture I could find in R.

    -   However - I'm not a huge fan of its syntax

-   For large inputs (1000+ input strings), `fugly` is significantly faster than `unglue`, `utils::strcapture` and \``ore`

-   The rust regex engine [rr4r](https://github.com/yutannihilation/rr4r) is slightly faster than `fugly`

-   `unglue` is the slowest of the methods.

-   `ore` lies somewhere between `unglue` and `utils::strcapture`

-   As pointed out by [Michael Barrowman](https://twitter.com/MyKo101AB), `tidyr::extract()` will also do named capture into a data.frame.

    -   Similar to `utils::strcapture()`, the names are not specified inline with the regex, but are listed separately.

   `rr4r::rr4r_extract_groups()` = rr4r::rr4r_extract_groups(string, "name:(?P<name>.*?) age:(?P<age>\\d+)"),
  `nc::capture_first_vec() PCRE` = nc::capture_first_vec(string, "Information name:", name=".*?", " age:", age="\\d+", engine = 'PCRE'),
  `tidyr::extract()` = tidyr::extract(data.frame(x = string), x, into = c('name', 'age'), regex = 'name:(.*?) age:(\\d+)'),
